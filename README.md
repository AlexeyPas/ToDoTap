# ToDoTap

## This application is my counterpart to many other ToDo applications. It implements: registration, authentication, logout, transitions between windows, adding tasks, deleting them and marking the release. There are three main windows: Today, Tomorrow and This week. After registering on the cloud, an account is created in which your data is saved. Upon authorization, the data is pulled from the server and any changes are immediately uploaded to FireBase.

### Application architecture used: VIPER
### Cloud storage: FireBase
### Layout of screen elements: PinLayout
